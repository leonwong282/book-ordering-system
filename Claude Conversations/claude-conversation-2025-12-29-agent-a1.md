Hello! I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans. 

I can see we're in a book ordering system repository with some recent changes to the database, main windows, and backend logic. 

Please provide the requirements you'd like me to work on, and I'll:
1. Explore the codebase thoroughly
2. Understand the current architecture
3. Design an implementation plan based on your needs
4. Identify critical files and dependencies

What would you like me to focus on?
